1. NORSU
Norsu browser extension is a software application extending the functionality of
web browsers in order to enable users to make easy interactions with third party websites
and applications accepting TAC blockchain compatible crypto-payments with User
wallets, and websites and applications to interact with the TAC blockchain through the
Norsu API, while the user keeps his/her SEED safe and is able to approve
transactions without entering private SEED on third-parties web resources and
applications.

To use Norsu you have to have and provide SEED phrase of a TAC blockchain wallet
owned by you exclusively and under your sole and full control (“User Wallet”).
Using Norsu, you are solely responsible for keeping your SEED. We will encrypt
your SEED with a password you provide to Norsu. We do not store your SEED

compatible crypto payments with a browser with installed and running a Norsu

services and websites from your connected User Wallet without sharing your SEED
and passwords related to such User Wallet with such websites and service;

• THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND WEBSITES to request your User Wallet balance and/or
